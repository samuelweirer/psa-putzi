- **Urgency:** 🟢 Normal - can start with local auth first

---

## 📅 Tomorrow's Plan (Day 3)

### High Priority

- [ ] Build and test Register page
- [ ] Implement form validation

### Normal Priority
- [ ] Add loading spinners and better error messages

## 🔧 Technical Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Switch to Unified Branch
- **What:** Merged frontend work into auth backend's branch
- **Why:** Real-time integration, avoid merge conflicts, test together
- **Alternatives:** Keep separate branches (causes delays and conflicts)
- **Impact:** Both frontend and backend agents
- **Reversible:** No (and shouldn't be - this is better)
- **Documentation:** `.subagents/FRONTEND-BRANCH-SWITCH.md`

### Decision 2: Use Vite instead of Create React App
- **What:** Selected Vite as build tool
- **Why:** Faster dev server, better HMR, smaller bundle size
- **Alternatives:** CRA (deprecated), Next.js (too heavy)
- **Impact:** All frontend development
- **Reversible:** Difficult after setup
- **Documentation:** Standard Vite config

### Decision 3: Radix UI + Tailwind CSS
- **What:** Using Radix UI primitives + Tailwind for styling
- **Why:** Accessible, customizable, type-safe, no runtime CSS-in-JS
- **Alternatives:** MUI (too opinionated), Ant Design (less flexible)
- **Impact:** Component development approach
- **Reversible:** Moderate effort
- **Documentation:** `implementation/13-MODULE-Frontend.md`

## 💡 Learnings & Notes

### What Went Well
- Branch switch to unified approach was seamless
- All components created cleanly with TypeScript
- Clear separation of concerns (AuthContext, pages, components)
- API client with interceptors works elegantly

### What Could Be Better
- Should have started on unified branch from beginning
- Need to add more error handling edge cases
- Form validation could be more robust

### Tips for Next Session
- The auth service has 16 endpoints ready (12 local + 4 OAuth)
- Test login with dummy account first before building more UI
- Remember to push frequently to unified branch
